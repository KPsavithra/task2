Project Summary â€“ SuperStore Sales Data Visualization

For this task, I used the SuperStore sales dataset to create a clean and insightful Power BI dashboard focused on business storytelling.

Steps Taken:

Data Preparation:

Loaded and transformed the dataset using Power BI.

Checked for errors and blanks; removed two columns with null values.

Replaced 0 with 1 in the Returns column for consistency.


Visualizations Created:

Clustered Bar Chart to compare Sales by Category.

Applied a Top N filter to show the Top 3 Sub-Categories by Sales.

Area Chart to show the trend of Profit over Order Dates.

Map Visualization to display Sales distribution across States.


Enhancements:

Used Format Painter for consistent chart styling and formatting.

Added a Slicer for Region to enable dynamic filtering.

Created KPI Cards to highlight key metrics such as Total Sales, Profit, and Orders.


DAX Calculation:

Used the DATEDIFF() function to calculate the Average Delivery Time between Order Date and Ship Date.
